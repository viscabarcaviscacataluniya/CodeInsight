🧠 CodeInsight

CodeInsight is your interactive playground for learning, running, and visualizing algorithms in real time.
Built with ❤️ using React + TypeScript, it helps students, developers, and interview-prep warriors truly “see” how algorithms work — through live visualizations, instant code execution, and step-by-step complexity breakdowns.
Think of it as your personal algorithm mentor that never gets tired.

🚀 Why CodeInsight?

Learning algorithms from plain text can feel… dry.
With CodeInsight, you don’t just read algorithms — you experience them:
🎥 Watch algorithms unfold step by step with interactive visualizations.
💻 Write and execute code directly in the browser using Judge0 API.
📊 Get complexity analysis at a glance — time, space, everything.
⚡ See real-time feedback as your code changes.
🧩 Extend the platform by easily adding your own algorithms.
Whether you’re preparing for FAANG/MAANG interviews, teaching a class, or simply sharpening your DSA skills — CodeInsight makes algorithms click.

🛠️ Tech Behind the Magic

React + TypeScript → Scalable, type-safe frontend foundation.
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui → Modern, minimal UI design system.
Judge0 API → Run code live, get outputs instantly.
D3.js / react-force-graph → Smooth, interactive graph visualizations.
Vite → Blazing-fast builds and hot reloads.

✨ What You Can Do

📊 Visualize Algorithms
Understand BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, and more through interactive graphs.
💻 Run Code in Real Time
Test your logic instantly — no setup, no hassle.
🧮 Check Complexities
See the time & space complexity for each algorithm.
🧩 Customize & Extend
Add new algorithms without breaking the existing flow.
🎯 Perfect for Learners & Interview Prep
Gain intuition that sticks longer than rote memorization.

⚡ Getting Started

Here’s how you can set it up locally:
1️⃣ Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/viscabarcaviscacataluniya/CodeInsight
cd CODEINSIGHT
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install
3️⃣ Configure Environment
Create a .env.local file in the root and add your Judge0 API credentials:
VITE_JUDGE0_API_HOST=your_host_url

VITE_JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_api_key

4️⃣ Run the App
npm run dev

5️⃣ Open in Browser
👉 http://localhost:5173

🌍 Roadmap

✅ Core algorithm visualizations
✅ Judge0 integration for code execution
🚧 More algorithm coverage (sorting, DP, greedy)
🚧 Multi-language support (Python, C++, Java, etc.)
🚧 Collaboration features (shareable sessions, classrooms)

🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributors! 💡
If you’ve got an idea for a new feature or algorithm, feel free to:
