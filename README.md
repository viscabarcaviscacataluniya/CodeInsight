# 🧠 CodeInsight

**CodeInsight** is an interactive algorithm visualization and code execution platform built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It allows students and developers to understand how algorithms work in real time through visualizations, live code execution via the **Judge0 API**, and complexity analysis — all in one seamless interface.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React + TypeScript**: For building scalable, type-safe frontends.
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: For modern, responsive UI components.
- **Judge0 API**: Executes code and captures outputs in real time.
- **D3.js / react-force-graph**: For dynamic graph-based visualizations.
- **Vite**: For lightning-fast development build tooling.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Algorithm Visualizations**  
  Graph-based rendering for algorithms like Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Dijkstra’s, BFS, and DFS.

- 💻 **Code Execution**  
  Run code instantly using Judge0 with syntax validation and live output.

- 🧮 **Complexity Analysis**  
  View time and space complexity for supported algorithms.

- ⚡ **Live Feedback**  
  Real-time editor updates with instant visualization refresh.

- 🧩 **Extensible Design**  
  Easily add new algorithms via plug-and-play architecture.
